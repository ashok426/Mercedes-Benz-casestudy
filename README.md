Kaggle conducts a Mercedes-Benz greener manufacturing challenge which focuses on environmental concerns in reducing the greenhouse effect caused by the emission of carbon dioxide during tests that are conducted before the cars hit the roads. Every car manufacturer undergoes effective and rigorous testing of the safety, reliability of their cars. Mercedes-Benz being one of the pioneers of car manufacturers ensures the same. Each car has varied configurations and checks according to its make. Thus testing time varies for different car types. More the configurations, more the tests, more the testing time.

Thus the objective of this problem is to accurately predict the test time of a car on the test bench given its features. By predicting test time exactly, the time spent by cars on the test bench could be optimized by Mercedes-Benz which overall optimizes time is taken, resources spent and carbon dioxide emitted.
